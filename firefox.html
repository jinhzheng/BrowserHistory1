<p>The project which became <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Firefox-Brand-US-GGL-Exact&utm_term=firefox&utm_content=A144_A203_A006336&gclid=CjwKCAiAk4XUBRB5EiwAHBLUMalniQfCfACz8Ld9uocTDmNxyNNA6MNUOz6sf8GAMk7VyLHalKgE2BoCK3MQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Firefox</a> started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.

<p>Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled by default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to have to "switch to a different search provider across the entire browser," and a global browser console, a new network monitor among other things.
